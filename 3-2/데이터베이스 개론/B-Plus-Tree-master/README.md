1) Creating a fresh tree:
	simply execute without any log file (`$./a.out`)  
	give `insert <key>` command in the program
2) Inserting keys:
	give `insert <key>` command in the program
3) Deleting keys:
	give `delete <key>` command in the program
4) Search keys:

5) Display tree in depth first manner:
	give `display` command in the program
6) Save log:
	give `save` command in the program and then give filename
7) Load tree from a log file:
